#### Description
This was a little project inspired by Jacob Wunder's [Tap Tap Pop](http://jacobwunder.com/tap-tap-pop/). I desired to do most of the visual sugar with CSS, however, and this formed a large part of my code. The JavaScript in my implementation is simply to keep score and control the game, and the HTML is the basic framework.

Also an "extras" project under my blog, [TheHomeworkLife](http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life)).

#### Features
- All CSS3-driven animations
- Minimalistic, modern interface
- Fast, responsive touch
